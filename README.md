Carcassonne

Description:
JSwing Application for Carcassonne (See board game wiki: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcassonne)

Some Improvements to Make:

num of each tile remaining panel

music/sound fx

zoom in / zoom out

save/load feature

AI player

Fix new game feature when switching decks (why need to do new game twice for scroll view to work properly?
This may have to do with the center view function....)
